## Election: Audit Summary
### Perks of this script
This analysis is effective because it checks identifies each county and each candidate, regardless of the turnout, number of candidates, or counties they voted in. 

### Advice
- I would advise adding a voter fraud checkpoint. The data provided could easily allow a check to ensure the same Ballot ID was not used multiple times.
- I would also advise adding a separate section to the data that outlines all potential candidates and counties. It is possible that other counties were eligible and there was no turnout, so they went unnoticed; that county should be listed with other counties as 0% turnout. Similarly, there may be a candidate out there who wonders why their results weren't shown as a result of their name and vote count (of 0) being absent from our list.
- Another addition that may be of interest is identifying candidate support by county, or the inverse - county enthusiasm for each candidate.

## Visual Snapshot
Admittedly, this is not the view expected from completing Deliverable 2. However, I decided to take this snapshot of the resulting Terminal Panel when "Up to 7" script is run:
